# APWorldHistoryReview
## Hello!
This is pretty straightforward, but it is just a simple question bank, generating random questions for AP World History. It only contains Units 0-5, sadly, but I hope the 185 questions help!
Additionally, you can change what units you want to target, especially if you are struggling on one. Go to the ShsGameInfo class and make the FINAL_UNITS_COVERED String at the bottom include the Units from 0-5 you need help on!
Good luck on the AP Exam!
